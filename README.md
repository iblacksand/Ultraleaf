# Ultraleaf

This will be a LaTeX editor that will support Overleaf offline but will enable collaboration in real time.

## Installation for development

Users will have to first install [git]() **and add it to your PATH**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iblacksand/Ultraleaf.git
cd Ultraleaf
npm install
npm run .
```
